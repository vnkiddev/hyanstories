# Storytime Library

A single-page experience for uploading, organizing, and reading illustrated PDFs with optional audio narration.

## Features
- Upload a PDF and matching audio file to create a book entry stored in the browser.
- Automatic cover generation from the first page of the PDF.
- Home grid of book cards that open a full-screen reader.
- "Read to me" mode: starts the audio track and automatically turns pages on a timer.
- "Read by myself" mode: manual navigation with buttons or arrow keys.

## Getting started
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. All data is stored in `localStorage`, so uploads persist on the same device.
